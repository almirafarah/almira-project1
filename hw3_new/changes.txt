1. simulator.cpp: if (eqPos == std::string::npos) the entire block was changed
        (if and else) so it cant tolerate --key = value with space between them
        and added a error meassage to unknownArgs.

2.simulator_new is the same as simulator but divided into more functions

added namespace

TankAlgorithm: deleted the defender and cahnged the func make_my_tank_algorithm_factory
                the deleted lines are in comments
